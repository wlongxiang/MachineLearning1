Bayes rule
 - Independent random variables
 
 Maxim Likelihood?? find weight distribution that maximize the likelihood of the dataset
 
 log likelihood to deal with extreme values for computational convenience.
 
 
 
 MAP vs maxm likelihood
 Max likelihood is special case of MAP when the prior distribution of weights is flat
 
 Questions:
 
 - Example of known prior of weights????
 - Homework 2.1.a
